Git Repos

Separate repos and issue merge request after project is done. 

Features to Add
---------------
1) Play Button
2) Fixing Collision Detection between double cuts   

Collision Detection
-------------------
uinode.js contains the code for representing nodes and drawing nodes. 

dragMove(float, float);

dragMove() function in Level.js (line 180)
------------------------------------------

Potential Problems: noCollision SHOULD be called false somewhere; unknown where noCollision is called false.  
Theory: Only checking for noCollision for the LAST object; ignores the rest of the objects.   

Class Relationships
-------------------
UINode is PARENT of Level and Variable class.
Level = Cuts; Variable = Letters.
If any Level/Variable is created, then the dragMove() function is bound a handler that object.
